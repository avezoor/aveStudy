# aveStudy

**aveStudy** is a collection of solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) using Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). In addition, this repository includes educational materials related to mathematics and computer science.

## Contents

- **Project Euler Solutions**: Well-documented solutions to various problems from Project Euler, showcasing mathematical and programming techniques.
- **Educational Materials**: Learning resources and notes on mathematical concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Project Euler Solutions**:
   - Each problem is solved using Python and is available in a Jupyter notebook format for easy visualization and interaction.
   - The solutions demonstrate both mathematical derivations and coding practices.

2. **Learning Materials**:
   - Contains notes and tutorials on relevant topics such as algorithms, data structures, and theoretical mathematics.
   - Supplementary resources for understanding the concepts used in solving Project Euler problems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To explore the solutions and materials, you need the following tools installed on your system:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
- Recommended: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for enhanced computation and visualization.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avezoor/aveStudy.git
   ```
